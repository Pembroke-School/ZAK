### Credits:
The code in this repo was written by Oscar Zhou and Louis Kent.
Thank you to [Nomic AI](https://gpt4all.io/index.html) for providing us with their awesome GPT4ALL models! They're truly amazing.

## Basic Setup
### Main Setup
The code in this repository requires the following Python packages: TKinter and GPT4ALL.  
Make sure that all packages are up-to-date as well.  

### Run Terminal Version
To run the skinned-down version (without GUI), simply clone into this repository.  
Then, CD into the */AI Python Skinned Down Section/* directory. To do so, run the following command:
```
cd AI\ Python\ Skinned\ Down\ Section
```
Then, run the *runmodel.py* file in that directory with:
```
python3 runmodel.py
```
The model will start downloading. This should take around 10 minutes providing that you have an average internet connection. The model should only have to be downloaded once. Check out [NomicAI's website](https://gpt4all.io/index.html) for more information on the llama-2-7b-chat.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin model used in this project.

### Run GUI Version
To run the GUI version (the full version), simply clone into this repository.  
Then, CD into the */Main/* directory. To do so, run the following command:
```
cd Main
```
Then, run the *main.py* file in that directory with:
```
python3 main.py
```
The model will start downloading. This should take around 10 minutes providing that you have an average internet connection. The model should only have to be downloaded once. Check out [NomicAI's website](https://gpt4all.io/index.html) for more information on the llama-2-7b-chat.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin model used in this project.
